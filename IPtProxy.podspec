  s.summary          = 'Obfs4proxy and Snowflake Pluggable Transports for iOS'

  s.description      = <<-DESC
    Both Obfs4proxy and Snowflake Pluggable Transports are written in Go, which
    is a little annoying to use on iOS.
    This pod encapsulates all the machinations to make it work and provides an
    easy to install binary including a wrapper around both.

    Problems solved in particular are:

    - One cannot compile `main` packages with `gomobile`. Both PTs are patched
      to avoid this.
    - Both PTs are gathered under one roof here, since you cannot have two
      `gomobile` frameworks in your iOS code, since there are some common Go
      runtime functions exported, which will create a name clash.
    - Environment variable changes during runtime will not be recognized by
      `goptlib` when done from within Swift/Objective-C. Therefore, sensible
      values are hardcoded in the Go wrapper.
    - The ports where the PTs will listen on are hardcoded, since communicating
      the used ports back to the app would be quite some work (e.g. trying to
      read it from STDOUT) for very little benefit.
    - Snowflake currently can only be configured via command line, not via the
      PT spec's method of using SOCKS username and password arguments.
      Therefore Snowflake is patched to accept arguments via its `Main` method.

    Both PTs are contained at their latest `master` commit, as per 2020-09-10.
